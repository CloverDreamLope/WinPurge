If the Software is distributed alongside other tools or in a larger compilation, it must be explicitly stated that WinPurge is an independent product created by CloverDreamLope.

Failure to provide proper attribution may result in the termination of your rights under this license. The Licensor reserves the right to pursue legal action if attribution requirements are not met.

# 5. Disclaimer of Warranties:

The Software is provided "as is," without any warranty of any kind, express or implied, including but not limited to the warranties of merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, and non-infringement. The Licensor makes no guarantee that the Software will function without errors, bugs, or interruptions, nor that it will meet the specific needs of any User.

However, the Licensor has an obligation to report and inform Users about any known risks associated with the Software. In the event of a bug, error, or any issue that may pose a risk to the User, the Licensor is responsible for addressing and fixing the issue through timely updates. Additionally, the Licensor must notify all Users of WinPurge about such issues and updates to ensure the continued safe use of the Software.

Your use of the Software is at your own risk. You assume full responsibility for any consequences that arise from using the Software
# 6. Limitation of Liability:

In no event shall the Licensor be liable for any direct, indirect, incidental, special, punitive, or consequential damages whatsoever, including but not limited to loss of profits, data, business interruption, or other commercial damages or losses, arising out of or related to your use or inability to use the Software, even if the Licensor has been advised of the possibility of such damages.

While the Licensor strives to maintain the highest standards of software development and user safety, no absolute guarantees can be made regarding the performance or security of the Software. The Licensor conducts rigorous testing and implements best practices to minimize potential risks and enhance the user experience. Despite these efforts, the inherent nature of software means that unforeseen issues may still occur.

The Licensor takes user safety seriously and commits to providing regular updates and security patches as necessary. However, the User acknowledges that software can never be entirely free of vulnerabilities. By using the Software, the User accepts these inherent risks.

The Licensor is not responsible for any third-party software conflicts, hardware malfunctions, or system incompatibilities that may arise from using the Software. The User is encouraged to back up important data and take necessary precautions when installing and running the Software.

Some jurisdictions do not allow the exclusion or limitation of incidental or consequential damages, so this limitation may not apply to you. In such cases, the Licensor's liability will be limited to the maximum extent permitted by applicable law.

# 7. Termination:

This license is effective until terminated. Your rights under this license will automatically terminate without notice if you fail to comply with any of its terms. Upon termination, you must immediately cease all use of the Software and destroy all copies in your possession or control.

Termination of this license does not limit any rights or remedies available to the Licensor under applicable law. Even after termination, sections regarding Attribution, Disclaimer of Warranties, Limitation of Liability, and Governing Law will continue to apply.

The Licensor reserves the right to modify or withdraw the Software at any time without notice. Continued use of the Software after changes to the license constitutes acceptance of those changes.

In the event of termination due to non-compliance, the User may be subject to legal action if unauthorized use, modification, or distribution of the Software is detected. The Licensor retains the right to pursue any legal remedies available to protect the integrity of the Software and uphold the terms of this license.

The Licensor is dedicated to maintaining the Software's integrity and providing a secure, reliable tool for all Users. By adhering to the terms of this license, Users contribute to a respectful and trustworthy software community.

Furthermore, the Licensor may conduct audits or reviews to ensure compliance with this license. Users found violating any terms may be required to provide written confirmation of their compliance or face further legal actions. The Licensor also reserves the right to publicly disclose violations to protect other Users from unauthorized or potentially harmful modifications.

In situations where termination occurs, Users are encouraged to provide feedback to the Licensor, allowing for improvements in future versions of the Software. This collaborative approach helps enhance the overall quality and reliability of WinPurge for the broader community.

Ultimately, the continued trust and cooperation between the Licensor and Users ensure that WinPurge remains a valuable, secure, and effective tool for all.
